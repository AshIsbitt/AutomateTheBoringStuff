## Automate the Boring Stuff with Python :snake:

#### Herein lies my solutions to the projects in [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) authored by the one and only [_Al Sweigart_](https://alsweigart.com/).

The earlier chapters (Ch1-6) have been skipped as they were a recap for me - as you can see from my earlier projects, I'm familiar with the basics of python already. However, I'm following the "Automating Tasks" section of the book so that I can grow more familiar and more skilled with the language.
